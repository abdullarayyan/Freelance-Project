# Freelance-Project
this project is a website e-learning used by university students and teachers to facilitate and enhance trust between them.
This idea came in light of the conditions and circumstances in which we live, mainly due to COVID-19 and the divergent need for e- learning education. 
This application facilitates the teaching process for teachers in terms of detecting cheating. That was discovered through the use of the camera to monitor students, so this maintains the credibility for the exams.

# Format: 
After completing the sign-in process and starting the test, the system activates the camera and identifies the student's face and the exam currency.

Case 1: After the face recognition process, if it is the student himself, the test continues without any hindrance.


Case 2: If more than one face is selected, the test will automatically end and you will return to the home page.


Case 3: If the specified face is not stored in the data, the scan is terminated.

Case 4: If an object such as a mobile phone is recognized or facial features change and the head movement is repeated, the test will be terminated and you will return to log in.
