# Freelance-Project
this project is a website e-learning used by university students and teachers to facilitate and enhance trust between them.
This idea came in light of the conditions and circumstances in which we live, mainly due to COVID-19 and the divergent need for e- learning education. 
This application facilitates the teaching process for teachers in terms of detecting cheating. That was discovered through the use of the camera to monitor students, so this maintains the credibility for the exams.
